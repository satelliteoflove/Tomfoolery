Note: "Party Conditions" are used to manage game state and trigger events.  For
instance, the player cannot save the game or look at the dungeon map while "in 
battle". When a party crosses a certain position, an event may be triggered. If
the party is facing a certain direction in a certain location and performs the
"search" action, a specific event may be triggered.
