Variables
-------
Party Conditions:
    In battle
    Engaged with NPC
    In camp
    On event trigger
    Facing direction x
    None of the above (implied)

Note: "Party Conditions" are used to manage game state and trigger events.  For
instance, the player cannot save the game or look at the dungeon map while "in 
battle". When a party crosses a certain position, an event may be triggered. If
the party is facing a certain direction in a certain location and performs the
"search" action, a specific event may be triggered.


Maps
----

1. Three arrays of objects - map_initial, and map_save (explored area), and
    map_in_play (current in memory copy). Map_initial and map_save are both 
    reflected in the files mapname.map and mapname.save

2. Map_in_play is generated:
	a. load the user-modified "map_save" array of "room" objects from
    mapname.save
	b. load the non-changing "map_initial" array of "room" objects from
    mapname.map
	c. For each object in "map_save", if "has_been_occupied" value is true
    copy the tuple to the "map_in_play" final array, else read the location
    value and load tuple with identical location value from "map_initial" into
    "map_in_play".

3. Map_in_play is updated:
	a. mark tuple in map_in_play at player location value "is_occupied" value
    true
	b. if event_on_occupy is not 0, play_event(event_on_occupy)
	c. mark tuple in map_in_play at player location value "has_been_occupied"
    to true

Values in each "tile" tuple:
	Location(x,y)
	Can_be_occupied(t/f)
    Is_occupied(t/f)
	Has_been_occupied(t/f)
	Event_on_occupy(event_number)
	What_is_(north/south/east/west)
		exit, wall, door, secret door, grate (triggered), event
