Map design and function

1. Three arrays of objects - map_initial, and map_save (explored area), and map_in_play (current in memory copy).
	Map_initial and map_save are both reflected in the files mapname.map and mapname.save

2. Map_in_play is generated:
	a. load the user-modified "map_save" array of "room" objects from mapname.save
	b. load the non-changing "map_initial" array of "room" objects from mapname.map
	c. For each object in "map_save", if "has_been_occupied" value is true copy the tuple to
		to the "map_in_play" final array, else read the location value and load tuple with
		identical location value from "map_initial" into "map_in_play".

3. Map_in_play is updated:
	a. mark tuple at player location value "has_been_occupied" value true
	b. if event_on_occupy is not 0, play_event(event_on_occupy)
	c. 

Values in each "tile" tuple:
	Location(x,y)
	Can_be_occupied(t/f)
	Has_been_occupied(t/f)
	Event_on_occupy(event_number)
	What_is_(north/south/east/west)
		exit, wall, door, secret door, grate (triggered), event
