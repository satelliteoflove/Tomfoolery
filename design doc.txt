Design and Function

Maps
====

1. Three arrays of objects - map_initial, and map_save (explored area), and map_in_play (current in memory copy).
	Map_initial and map_save are both reflected in the files mapname.map and mapname.save

2. Map_in_play is generated:
	a. load the user-modified "map_save" array of "room" objects from mapname.save
	b. load the non-changing "map_initial" array of "room" objects from mapname.map
	c. For each object in "map_save", if "has_been_occupied" value is true copy the tuple to
		to the "map_in_play" final array, else read the location value and load tuple with
		identical location value from "map_initial" into "map_in_play".

3. Map_in_play is updated:
	a. mark tuple in map_in_play at player location value "is_occupied" value true
	b. if event_on_occupy is not 0, play_event(event_on_occupy)
	c. mark tuple in map_in_play at player location value "has_been_occupied" to true

Values in each "tile" tuple:
	Location(x,y)
	Can_be_occupied(t/f)
    Is_occupied(t/f)
	Has_been_occupied(t/f)
	Event_on_occupy(event_number)
	What_is_(north/south/east/west)
		exit, wall, door, secret door, grate (triggered), event

Items
=====

Item properties:
Description         #Long description (if you investigate the item)
Name                #Long name (if you investigate the item)
Short_name          #Displayed in the character's inventory listing

Once acquired, items occupy an inventory slot until they are used or destroyed.  Items can be deposited in town at the appropriate shop (see "bank" below).

When "dropped", an item is destroyed and gone forever.

All items can be used at any time, but only have an effect under specific conditions.

Items such as potions and scrolls are single-use "portable spells" that can be used by any character class or race. When used, they are marked as "broken" and are unusable. In classic Wizardry, there is no way to repair these items - they just take up space until they are dropped (destroyed).

Should it be possible to "repair" "broken" items if certain conditions are met?

Equipment
=========
Weapons, Armor, Accessories are all "equipment" but are still instances of the "Item" class.  Equipment will have a different initialization method (__init__) which requires the appropriate input (listed below).

Equipment properties:
Is_equippable(t/f)
Is_equipped(t/f)
Min_dmg(int)
Max_dmg(int)
Hit_multiplier(float)


Bank
====
The "Bank" is an in-town shop which allows the player to store items and gold outside of a character's inventory.
The bank will not store anything for the player initially. The player will purchase an initial set of slots, and will need to purchase more slots as required. Unlike the characters' inventories, gold will not be "weightless" but will "stack" and require a slot to be stored in.  5k per slot.  Slots can be purchased in batches of 5 for 5k gold. Each item will take one slot.

General

    Party Conditions:
        In battle
        Engaged with NPC
        In camp
        On event trigger
        Facing direction x
