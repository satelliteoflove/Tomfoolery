This is some text to scroll.  It is my hope, that the pyglet
functionality built in to the ScrollableTextLayout thingy will
not require the specific use of the newline character.  But, it
probably will require that and much more.  Hard to say.  This
however is a running paragraph that might as well be Latin.
